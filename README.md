INTRODUCTION
1.	Carried out complete case study of Tesla by preparing 3 financial statement model from scratch in order to forecast the future projections of company’s financial condition by comparing the demands of Tesla’s existing automobile models with that of its peers. And the demands of new Tesla models to be introduced in near future.
2.	And in order to prepare a dynamic model, 3 scenarios namely (Base Case, Best Case and Worst Case) have been incorporated into the model to get a flexible model.
3.	And Tesla being in the automotive business, to calculate its revenue, we need to actually calculate no.of vehicles it delivers and its average selling price. And we also need to forecast the deliveries that will take place in future.

5.	And to forecast the future projections of Tesla’s financial condition, we need comparable values of certain P&L and balance sheet items of its peers competing in the same segment. And we need comparable values of Deliveries, comparable values of Gross Profit %, operating expenses and Property, Plant & Equipment for calculating Fixed Asset Roll Forward (deals with Beginning PP&E, CAPEX and D&A).

7.	For calculation of working capital, we need to calculate the historic value of DSO, DIO and DPO of the firm and then take its average to forecast future growth.
8.	For the financing activity, we need to forecast how the firm would manage to cover its negative cash flow in future. And for that case if its Unlevered Free Cash Flow is negative then only the firm would go for debt funding or issuing new equity shares. And to have a more dynamic model we can use different combination of debt and equity percentage as per the feasibility of the firm’s current financial condition. And to calculate the interest rate on fixed income securities i.e. debt funding, we need to check for 10 yrs Bond Yield value of US Treasury.

10.	And using all these information, we could able to prepare the 3 financial statements of the given firm.
